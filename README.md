This research employs clustering, an unsupervised machine learning method, to classify wines according to their physicochemical characteristics. Its objective is to categorize wines with akin chemical properties, thereby enabling tailored wine recommendations derived from these characteristics.

The study recognizes that factors like grape type, region, and vintage significantly impact wine flavors. However, it emphasizes the role of physicochemical attributes such as pH, density, residual sugars, and sulphates in influencing the more subtle aspects of flavor. It suggests that wines with analogous chemical structures could exhibit similar taste profiles, independent of their geographic origin or vintage year.

My goal is to perform a clustering analysis on red wines to decode the relationships between their physicochemical properties, enhancing the process of wine selection and appreciation. This method departs from traditional classification practices that are primarily based on region or vintage.

This analysis employs the red wine quality dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which comprises 11 physicochemical features and 4898 data points. Typically used for classification purposes, this dataset is considered apt for clustering analysis in my study.

This research introduces an innovative perspective in wine studies, pivoting from traditional external factor-based classification to a deeper analysis centered on chemical composition. Such findings could transform how individuals choose and enjoy wines, offering a more individualized approach based on chemical profiles.
